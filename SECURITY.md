# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

For the moment, as the only version is currently in development, it is the only one you want to report security issues on.
In the future, I will setup a list of versions that supports security updates, on which you want to report security issues.

<!--
| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In order to report a vulnerability, you want to :
 - Indicate which version of the engine do you use
 - Which version of the librairies are you using
 - Which OS are you using
 - Which file is concerned if you've seen a vulnerability
 - AND/OR the scenario I would have to reproduce if I wanted to exploit the vulnerability

I will try to fix these as soon as possible, thanks for sharing these 👍

<!--Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
